## Compiling from source

If you want to compile this package from source, make sure you have the latest version of GNU Fortran installed, which you can find on the [R Development Tools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) web page if you use OSX; on Windows make sure your Rtools includes Fortran. Fortran is needed to compile Fisher's original code which was written in Fortran.
